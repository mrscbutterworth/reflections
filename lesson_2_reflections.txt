How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The stating area allows you to add and change which files you are choosing to commit.  I started to add both reflections files to the staging area, but changed my mind and wanted to add just one, so was able to remove it with rm.  Flexibility.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical

You can stage files and then examine what changes have been made by using git diff and git diff --staged to compare between the working directory and the staging area and the staging area and the most recent commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
